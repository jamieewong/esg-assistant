# Youth ESG Financial Assistant

## Overview

The Youth ESG Financial Assistant is an early-stage project focused on developing a machine learning model to help younger investorsâ€”especially studentsâ€”make smarter, more responsible investment decisions. This tool aims to recommend stock investments based on both financial performance and the user's ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) preferences.

We aim to combine:

- Historical stock market data
- Public ESG ratings
- Demographic and spending behavior data
- Real-time financial data (via APIs like `yfinance`)

With this, our long-term goal is to create a personalized financial advisor that educates users on smart investing strategies while aligning with their values.
